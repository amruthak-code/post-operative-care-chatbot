## How It Works

1. A patient logs in through the web interface.
2. The backend:
   - Authenticates the user using JWT
   - Retrieves only that patient’s medical data from Redis
3. Relevant medical context is retrieved using **RAG**.
4. The LLM generates a response under strict safety rules.
5. The system returns:
   - A patient-facing explanation
   - A triage level (1–3)
   - An alert flag if escalation is required
6. Emergency-level cases trigger notification logic.

## Triage Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Routine | Self-care guidance |
| 2 | Caution | Recommend scheduling a clinician visit |
| 3 | Emergency | Trigger emergency contact alert |
